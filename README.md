# AI-RESUME-SCREENING-SYSTEM
THIS PROJECT IS PREPARED WITH AI USING CANDIDATE RESUME TO FIND OUT WHETHER THAT PERSON IS ELIGIBLE TO HIRE OR REJECT.
Project Overview
This project is an AI-based Resume Screening System that helps automatically analyze and classify resumes based on job requirements. It reduces manual effort in the recruitment process by using Machine Learning techniques to shortlist suitable candidates.

## 🎯 Objective
- Automate resume screening
- Reduce human bias
- Improve hiring efficiency
- Classify resumes based on job roles

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains resumes in text format with different job categories.  
Text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization were applied.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data collection
2. Text preprocessing
3. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
4. Model training
5. Resume classification
6. Performance evaluation

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes

## 📊 Output
- Automatically predicts job category for a given resume
- Helps HR teams shortlist candidates efficiently
